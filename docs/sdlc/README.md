## Open gaps

### Requirements

- ASSUMPTION (unverified): the four roles -- employee, manager, HR admin, executive/leadership read-only -- are assumed from confirmed understanding, not independently verified.
- ASSUMPTION (unverified): email/password authentication only -- no SSO or HRIS directory sync in the first release.
- ASSUMPTION (unverified): no payment, billing or subscription functionality exists; intentionally out of scope for this internal tool.
- ASSUMPTION (unverified): performance/employee data is treated as sensitive HR data under a single jurisdiction with GDPR-style practices (access control, retention, export/delete on request) and an audit trail, because the operating region was not specified.
- ASSUMPTION (unverified): a SMART/OKR-style structure (specific, measurable, with target and timeframe) is assumed from confirmed understanding; cascading is optional, not mandatory.
- ASSUMPTION (unverified): progress may be expressed as percentage or status, with a configurable per-goal check-in cadence.
- ASSUMPTION (unverified): email reminders require a provisioned email-sending credential (e.g. SendGrid/SMTP API key); in-app notifications are provided regardless.
- NFR-005/NFR-006 GDPR-style compliance and single-jurisdiction residency are both based on an unverified assumption (region unspecified) -- needs confirmation of actual operating jurisdiction and applicable data-protection regime before architecture/design relies on it.
